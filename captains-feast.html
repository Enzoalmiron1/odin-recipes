    <h3> Recipe</h3>

    <ol>
        <li> Two days before you plan on roasting the prime rib, combine the salt, rosemary, and garlic in a bowl.
Rub the mixed seasoning over the entire prime rib. Lay the meat on a baking sheet fitted with a rack and
place in the refrigerator uncovered . Allow the prime rib to rest for at least 48 hours and up to 96 hours. </li>
        <li> Take the prime rib out of the refrigerator for at least one hour before it goes into the oven and allow it to come to room temperature. Adjust an oven rack to the middle-lower position. Preheat the oven to 250 ° F.</li>
        <li> Take a deep baking dish with a roasting rack inserted and fill the bottom of the baking dish with celery,
            fennel, onion, rosemary, and thyme. Heavily season the prime rib with pepper. Lay the prime rib, fat
            side up, on the roasting rack. Place the meat in the oven and roast until the prime rib reaches the desired
            internal temperature: 130 ° F for medium-rare, 3 to 3 ½ hours; 135 ° F for medium, 3 ½ to 4 hours. </li>
        <li> 4. Remove the prime rib from the oven, loosely cover with aluminum foil, and let rest for 45 minutes.
            Increase the oven temperature to 500 ° F. Move the oven rack up to the top-middle of your oven .
            Remove the aluminum foil from the prime rib and place in the oven. Cook until the fat begins to crisp
            up, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the roast from the oven and place on a cutting board. Remove the
            bone and slice the meat into ½ -to-¾-inch-thick pieces and serve .</li>
